  Basic Information

    <div id="divOne" >
    I answer to Jimmy. I was born in raised in <a href="http://www.cityofcoweta-ok.gov/">Coweta, Oklahoma</a>. A small town southeast of Tulsa. Coweta is a  bustling metropolis containing about 10,000 residents. I have an older sister, Elizabeth, whose last day of Law School is today. I come from a multi-generational farming/ranching family. I grew up raising beef cattle with my father and grandfather. My grandfather bought my family its first home computer in 1999 and I have been attached to computers ever since. I moved to Fort Collins to attend Galvanize on Monday, April 18.

    I love playing indoor soccer and am a die-hard Manchester United fan. I'm bound to be up early on Saturday and Sunday mornings watching the EPL. If you know of any soccer pubs nearby please let me know.

    I also breed ball pythons with 2 of my friends. Our breeding group is Dragon Tamer Reptiles. I currently own about 20. Altogether we have about 60 ball pythons and are expecting 20+ clutches this summer.
