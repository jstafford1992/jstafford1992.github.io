  Basic Information
  </h1>

    <div id="divOne" class="">
    I answer to Jimmy. I was born in raised in <a href="http://www.cityofcoweta-ok.gov/">Coweta, Oklahoma</a>. A small town southeast of the Tulsa Metro. Coweta is a  bustling metropolis containing about 10,000 residents. I have an older sister, Elizabeth, who is set to graduate from OCU law school at the end of this semester and will be taking her BAR examination this summer. I come from a multi-generational farming/ranching family. I grew up raising beef cattle with my father and grandfather. We would get up every morning to feed before school every morning. My grandfather bought my family its first home computer in 1999 and I have been attached to computers ever since. I moved to Fort Collins to attend Galvanize on Monday, April 18.<button>

    I love playing indoor soccer and am a die-hard Manchester United fan. I'm bound to be up early on Saturday and Sunday mornings watching the EPL. In case you don't know, it is regarded as the greatest league in the world, and for good reason. If you know of any soccer pubs nearby please let me know.

    I also breed ball pythons with 2 of my friends. Our breeding group is Dragon Tamer Reptiles, so if you're in the market for a pet of the reptile variety I'd love to help you find the right one.

     I decided to actually dive in and start coding around December 2014 and floundered around in codecademy until I found Treehouse. They have great instructional videos and walkthroughs along with quizzes to keep you up on your toes. <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/jimmystafford">My profile</a>.
